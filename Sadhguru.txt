failure is a bad enough and fear is adding a spice to it.
success happens to you not because you desire it, because you earn it.
every body desires it .it comes only if you are capable of it.
Fear is  happening because of excessive imagination things that doesnot happen, you are creating.

Among 100 things that you have feared. probably 99 of them never happen.
you cannot fight or overcome the things that doesnot exist.
Enjoy the fear. After All its your making.
