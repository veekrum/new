Creating, cloning, and archiving repositories / Duplicating a repository

 To duplicate a repository without forking it, you can run a special clone command, then mirror-push to the new repository.

Before you can duplicate a repository and push to your new copy, or mirror, of the repository, you must create the new repository on GitHub. In these examples, exampleuser/new-repository or exampleuser/mirrored are the mirrors.
Mirroring a repository

    Open Terminal.

    Create a bare clone of the repository.

    git clone --bare https://github.com/exampleuser/old-repository.git

    Mirror-push to the new repository.

    cd old-repository.git
    git push --mirror https://github.com/exampleuser/new-repository.git

    Remove the temporary local repository you created in step 1.

    cd ..
    rm -rf old-repository.git
