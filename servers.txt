SERVER -*- mode: org -*-
** /APP Server/	
  - *An* app server is the thing that actually runs your Rails app. Your app server loads your code and keeps your app in memory. When your
   app server gets a request from your web server, it tells your Rails app about it. After your app is done handling the request, the app
    server sends the response back to the web server (and eventually to the user).
 
.. /you/ can run most app servers by themselves, without a web server in front of it. That’s probably what you do in development mode!
   In production, though, you’ll usually have a web server in front. It’ll handle multiple apps at once, render your assets faster, and
    deal with a lot of the processing you’ll do on every request. 

  -_There_ are a ton of app servers for Rails apps, including Mongrel (which isn’t used much anymore), Unicorn, Thin, Rainbows, and Puma. 
   Each has different advantages and different philosophies. But in the end, they all accomplish the same thing – keeping your Rails app
   running and handling requests.	
** WEB Servers
  -A web server is a program that takes a request to your website from a user and does some processing on it. Then, 
   it might give the request to your Rails app. Nginx and Apache are the two big web servers you’ll run into. 
 
 -If the request is for something that doesn’t change often, like CSS, JavaScript, or images, your Rails app probably doesn’t need to see it.
    The web server can handle the request itself, without even talking to your app. It’ll usually be faster that way.
 
 -Web servers can handle SSL requests, serve static files and assets, compress requests, and do lots of other things that almost every 
    website needs. And if your Rails app does need to handle a request, the web server will pass it on to your app server.

** working as Both Servers [ Passenger ]
 - [Phusion Passenger] is a little unique. In “standalone mode,” it can act just like an app server. But it can also be built right into a
    web server, so you don’t need a separate app server to run your Rails apps. 

 - This can be really convenient. Especially if you’re planning to run a bunch of apps and don’t want to spend time setting up an app server
   for each one. After installing Passenger, you just point the web server directly at your Rails app (instead of an app server), and your
    Rails app will start handling requests!
 - Passenger is a nice option, but having a separate app server can be still be good. Keeping the app server separate gives you the 
   flexibility to choose an app server that best fits your needs, and you can run and scale it on its own. Still, I’m going to try
   it again the next time I deploy a new small app. I’m hoping it’ll make it easier to deploy future apps to the same server.

** RACK 
 -Rack is the magic that lets any of these app servers run your Rails app. (Or Sinatra app, or Padrino app, or…)
 
 -You can think of Rack as a common language that Ruby web frameworks (like Rails) and app servers both speak.
  Because each side knows the same language, it means Rails can talk to Unicorn and Unicorn to Rails, without
   having either Rails or Unicorn know anything about the other.


** RELATION BETWEEN ALL THEM

 -So, how does this all fit together?

 - Out of these pieces, a web request will hit your web server first. If the request is something Rails can handle, the web server 
  will do some processing on the request, and hand it off to the app server. The app server uses Rack to talk to your Rails app. 
  When your app is done with the request, your Rails app sends the response back through the app server and the web server to the
   person using your app.

 - More specifically, Nginx might pass a request to Unicorn. Unicorn gives the request to Rack, which gives it to the Rails router, 
   which gives it to the right controller. Then, your response just goes back through the other way.
