** SSH_Config
   - we can manage the ssh clients on the .ssh_config files
   - we can write a block of codes like
      
 
       Host keepAsULike
         Hostname URL or IP
         User Username
         port 23

   - this works as a [ssh -p 23 Username@IP]
     - we can Login by just [ SSH keepAsULike ]
