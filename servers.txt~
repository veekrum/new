** WEB Servers
  -A web server is a program that takes a request to your website from a user and does some processing on it. Then, 
   it might give the request to your Rails app. Nginx and Apache are the two big web servers you’ll run into. 
  -If the request is for something that doesn’t change often, like CSS, JavaScript, or images, your Rails app probably doesn’t need to see it.
    The web server can handle the request itself, without even talking to your app. It’ll usually be faster that way.
  -Web servers can handle SSL requests, serve static files and assets, compress requests, and do lots of other things that almost every 
    website needs. And if your Rails app does need to handle a request, the web server will pass it on to your app server.
