** RACK
rails app doesnot understand the direct request. so the rack works as a middleware between rails app and the server.
It is just a guidelines for how a server and rails appa should talk each other

#Request sent by browser
 // Request by the browser

GET /users HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Connection: close
--------------------------



// Response by the server

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 25
Content-Type: text/html
<html>
...
</html>

----------------------------
// Server to Rails app

env = {
  'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'GET',
  'PATH_INFO' => '/users',
  'HTTP_VERSION' => '1.1',
  'HTTP_HOST' => 'localhost',
  ...
  ...
}

----------------------------
// Rails app to server

[
  200,
  {
    'Content-Length' => '25',
    'Content-Type' => 'text/html'
  },
  [
    '<html>',
    '...',
    '</html>'
  ]
]

Scm-SOurce Control Management
** Sinatra
   -First of all its a Ruby FrameWork 
   -It is the Ruby API framework for the non-GUI Apps.
   -It works a micro services.
   -Its work is to request the Api calls from the App to the Server
** Monolithic Services and micro services
   -Monolithic means the all the services are working under one processes.
   -Micro services are there are the lots of the independent services running on the kernel.
   - Micro services has a plus point because if one of the services fails the other continues so the system does not crash.
